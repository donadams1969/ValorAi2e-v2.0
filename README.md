<h1 align="center">🛡️ FortressDelegate.sol</h1>
<h3 align="center">EIP-7702 Smart Wallet Logic Contract • Built for VALORChain • ZK & IPFS Ready</h3>

---

## 🌐 Overview

FortressDelegate is a military-grade smart contract that transforms a normal wallet into a smart contract fortress using [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702). Designed for ultra-secure execution, circuit-breaker defense, and extensible integrations, it turns your EOA into a session-aware, rules-driven contract wallet—**without giving up simplicity**.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

| 🚀 Feature              | 🧠 Description |
|------------------------|----------------|
| 🔐 Role-Based Access   | Only approved delegates may execute |
| 🔁 Nonce Protection     | Prevents signature replays via strict sequencing |
| ⚠️ Circuit Breaker     | Owner can freeze execution in emergencies |
| 💣 Self-Destruct       | Optional exit strategy back to ETH-only EOA |
| 📝 Logs & Events        | Every action is logged for forensic tracking |
| 🌐 ZK & IPFS Ready     | Modular for private proofs & decentralized audit trails |

---

## 🔧 Contract Details

```solidity
function execute(
  address target,
  bytes calldata data,
  uint256 nonce,
  uint256 maxValue
) external whenNotPaused;
````

* ✅ Uses `Ownable` and `Pausable` from OpenZeppelin
* ✅ Every caller is authenticated
* ✅ ETH transfer limits enforced per transaction
* ✅ Emits events for logs, authorizations, and circuit breaks

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

```text
[EOA signs tx] → [7702 attaches logic pointer] → [FortressDelegate receives tx] 
→ [Verifies caller, nonce, gas, value] → [Executes call] → [Returns to EOA mode]
```

## 🔐 Security Matrix

| 🛡 Threat                | ✅ Fortress Response                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Replay Attacks           | Nonce-enforced calls                        |
| Unauthorized Access      | Role-based caller mapping                   |
| ETH Overdraw             | Max value parameter in `execute`            |
| Phishing Logic Injection | Only whitelisted delegate contracts allowed |
| Gas Griefing             | Gas and value limits                        |
| Emergency Events         | Circuit breaker (`triggerEmergency()`)      |
